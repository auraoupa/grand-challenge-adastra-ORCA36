# Meeting ORCA36

## Ordre du jour

Update on Mercator's simulations with ORCA36 configuration.
A list of themes we want to discuss :
 - performances
 - bathymetry
 - atmospheric forcing
 - NEMO version
 - tidal forcing (loading ?)
 - ice-shelves (interactive ? ice-draft ? bed machine cf Pierre Mathiot ?)
 - regarding the outputs :
	 - ice and eke state
   - circulation under ice-shelves
	 - suitable initial state for our experiment ?


## Summary

 - A twin experiment with and without tides has been performed on European Center
 - Data likely available on wekeo at the end of the summer
 - a lot of work dedicated to improve coordinates and bathymetry (AGRIF and coarsening compatible
 - on offline observation operator developped in MOI to retrieve alongtrack, satellite data, in situ and sea ice observations


## Compte-rendu 

Clément prepared slides : https://cloud.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/s/AE3dPTN5fAbzYLf

My notes (not in the slides)

Computation at European Center much easier and efficient than on MareNOstrum (2 month produced in a day, when no data transfer issues)
100 nodes for XIOS, 200 for NEMO

Test of the next pre hexascale machine lumi, Finland

ROMS-TOOLS to modify bathymetry, mean level modified to prepare for wetting and drying 
Quid bathy FES2022 ?? test at 1/12° : it is worse, not adapted to partial steps (too many spikes)

operationnal forcing not available for us, ERA5 is the next best thing, hourly not necessary (no interaction between ocean and atm) but minimum 3h frequency
Romain : be careful, ERA5 is 1/4° colder compared to ERAinterim

Tides: loading = 1 file per component

GLS better than TKE for restratification, patch for uv bands even better but not available yet in NEMO

Casimir param for internal waves not when explicit tides

NOOBS operator between NEMO production and recombining of files (you can delete big 3D data after), also produces statistics for run validation

Shallow water NEMO -> cf Jérôme

Data distributed on wekeo, conversion to zarr necessary, 1Pb/year for 3D hourly outputs

To be done next : 
  - same twin simulations 1/12° (1/4° already done)
  - test 1 year with RK3 (bigger time step, up to 240s would be nice but still fails)
  - diagnostics on GPU


## To do

 - [ ] contact F. Lyard & Laurène pour bathy FES2022
 - [ ] check wekeo access
